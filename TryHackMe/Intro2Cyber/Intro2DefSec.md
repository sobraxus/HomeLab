## Introduction to Defensive Security

### What is Defensive Security?
- The opposite of offensive - Protecting systems from threats and detecting when they occur

### Tasks covered by a blue team:
- Security Awareness Training
- Documentating and asset management
- Updating/Patching systems
- Setting up preventative security - IDS/IPS (SNORT/Meraki)
- Setting up logging - rsyslog for example
- Setting up monitoring - Suricata

### SOC:

- Monitor network and systems for security events. Specifically looking for 
-- Vulnerabilities
-- Policy violations
-- Unauthorized Activity
-- Network Intrusions

### Threat intelligence
- Gathering data
- Analysing
- Learning about adversaries. 
-- I use "adversaries" in a wide context here, anything that will adversly affect the estate, vulnerability in software to an external attacker.


### Digital Forensic Incident Response (DFIR)

- Digital Forensics

-- File Systems: Analysing system storage - Autopsy
-- System Memory: Analysing running program - GDB
-- System Logs: Log files Kibana
-- Network Logs: Logs of network packets - .pcap file

- Incdient response

-- Preperation
-- Detection and Analysis
-- Containment, Eradication, Recovery
-- Post Incident Activity

- Malware Analysis
